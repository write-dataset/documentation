      <p>WRITE digital archive aims to store, preserve, analyse and disseminate the data collected through the <i>WRITE</i> project.</p>
	  <p>The <b><a href="https://writecalligraphyproject.eu/">WRITE project - New Forms of Calligraphy in China: A Contemporary Culture Mirror</a></b> - wants to investigate how the emergence of new forms of calligraphy in contemporary China has been playing a pivotal role in the re-definition of Chinese cultural identity. Given the evergrowing presence of calligraphy in contemporary arts, the central core of the project is to systematically analyse all these new art forms.</p>
	  <p>This <b>dataset documentation</b> stores detailed information about the data collected by the domain experts involved in the WRITE project.</p>

	<p>The core of the WRITE dataset are four collections corresponding to four types of art:</p>
	</div>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-2">
		<h5>Visual Arts</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h5>Decorative and Applied Arts</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2">
		<h5>Graffiti Art</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h5>Performing Arts</h5>
	</div>
  </div>
  
 <br>
  <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
	<div>
	<p>Starting from these art types, by employing <i>WRITE data model</i>, this dataset structures and preserves all the data that represent the miscellaneous nature of the Chinese contemporary calligraphic phenomenon. The choice to employ the <i>Linked Open Data</i> and <i>FAIR</i> principles was made in order to bridge the data silos and to be introduced into the Knowledge Graph.</p> 
	<p>Using LOD will also contribute to the analysis of the dataset on three different levels: <b>1)</b> artistic, <b>2)</b> linguistic and <b>3)</b> socio-political-economic. Artistic analysis deals with formal and stilistic aspects of the artworks, linguistic analysis comprises both the presence of calligraphy within the artworks as well as the critical and other texts related to the artworks, while socio-political-economic analysis offers information about clients, patrons, public response, etc.</p>
	<p>A special place in this data model is dedicated to the so-called <b>"calli-writing" units</b>, which are the core feature for the calligraphic investigation of this project (see more in the <i>model -> Calli-Writing Unit</i> section).</p>
	<p>In this dataset documentation you can get an insight into the particularities of the WRITE data model (see <b>model</b>), see how it is applied in 4 representative examples for each of the four collections (see <b>case studies</b>), and finally, view, browse and download the complete dataset and ontologies that constitute the data model (see <b>RDF data</b>).</p>
